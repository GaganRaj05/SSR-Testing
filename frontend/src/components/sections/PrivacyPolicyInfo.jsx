        At LegalEasier, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring
        a safe online experience. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect,
        use, and protect your information, specifically regarding SMS marketing,
        and outlines your rights concerning your personal data.
      </p>

      <h2 className="terms-h">1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        When you opt-in to receive SMS messages from us, we collect the
        following information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Phone Number:</strong> The mobile number you provide when you
          subscribe to our SMS marketing service.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent:</strong> Your explicit consent to receive marketing
          communications via SMS. By opting in, you agree to receive marketing
          messages, updates, promotions, and other communications related to our
          products and services.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="terms-h">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We use your phone number and consent to send you SMS marketing messages
        that may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Promotions, discounts, and offers related to our services.</li>
        <li>
          Updates, reminders, and information about new products or services.
        </li>
        <li>Customer service and support messages.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your phone number and consent will only be used for the purposes
        described above and will not be used for any unrelated purposes.
      </p>

      <h2 className="terms-h">3. Data Sharing and Protection</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell, rent, or lease your personal information (including your
        phone number) to third parties. We may share your phone number with
        trusted third-party service providers solely for the purpose of sending
        SMS messages (e.g., SMS gateways). These service providers are required
        to keep your information confidential and use it solely to deliver our
        services to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from
        unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, please note
        that no method of transmission over the internet or via electronic
        storage is 100% secure.
      </p>

      <h2 className="terms-h">4. Opt-Out and Withdrawal of Consent</h2>
      <p>
        You have the right to withdraw your consent and opt-out of receiving SMS
        marketing messages at any time. To unsubscribe from our SMS
        communications, simply reply “STOP” to any SMS message we send. Once you
        opt-out, you will no longer receive marketing messages, although you may
        still receive transactional or service-related messages if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any issues opting out or need further assistance, please
        contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@legaleasier.org">contact@legaleasier.org</a>.
      </p>

        we will update the effective date at the top of this page. We encourage
        you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are
